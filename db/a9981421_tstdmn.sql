Penalty corner specialist Sandeep Singh\'s nine lethal drag-flicks have powered India into the finals of London 2012 Olympic qualifiers.\r\nIt\'s ironic, though, that the eight-time Olympic gold-medalists have to go through the jitters in a qualification tournament, but the state of the national game hasn\'t been the same since the Moscow Games in 1980, when India last won an Olympic medal (gold) in hockey.\r\nBut the rich hockey heritage and resilience of \'Singhs\' was not the one to get perturbed with the setbacks on and off the field. The \'white turban\' has been part of every Indian team since 1928. Players like Udham Singh and Balbir Singh Sr. laid the foundation of this legacy, which passed on through names such as Ajit Pal Singh and Pargat Singh to the 21st-century crop led by Sandeep Singh and Sardar Singh.\r\nHowever, it\'s a team game and the contribution of other stalwarts, led by hockey wizard Major Dhyanchand, is none less superior. Legends like Dhyanchand, Baboo Nimal and Ashok Kumar had a strong role in helping the \'Singhs\' build the stature that they now enjoy in the game and it will be a sin to overlook that.\r\nBut since we are talking about \'Singh\' the \'King\', let\'s take a look at a few of the records that put them in a different league.\r\n1. Ajit Singh has scored the fastest-ever goal in Olympic history. It came in just 15 seconds from the start of India\'s opening game against Argentina in the 1976 Montreal Games. It was also the first Olympic goal scored on the astro turf.\r\n2. Balbir Singh Sr. enjoys the feat of winning three consecutive Olympic gold medals (1948, 1952 and 1956). He was also the captain in the 1956 Melbourne Games. He shares this record with hockey wizard Dhyanchand. Balbir also holds the Guinness World Record for most goals (5) scored by a player in an Olympic men’s hockey final. He earned this distinction in 1952.\r\n3. Udham Singh entered the Guinness Book for participating in four consecutive Olympics (1952-1964). Kenya’s Avtar Singh Sohal and Surjeet Singh Panesar later equalled Udham\'s record (1960 to 1972).\r\n4. Prithipal Singh enjoys the possession of all three Olympic medals – Gold (1964), Silver (1960) and Bronze (1968).\r\n5. Jugraj Singh was India\'s first penalty corner specialist but injury brought a premature end to his promising career.\r\nAnd once again as India stand on the threshold of an Olympic qualification, the team has been served by as many as four players donning the \'white turban\' – Sandeep Singh (defender and penalty corner specialist), Sardar Singh (midfielder), Sarvanjit Singh (forward) and Gurwinder Singh Chandi (forward). But what matters most is that the team is shaping up into a well-knit unit and looking good to hit an upward curve under coach Michael Nobbs.','content-images/sandeep.jpg','In Indian hockey, Singh is King!','India are just a step away from getting back into the Olympics.',10,1),(2,'ZeeNews.com','2012-02-24 08:01:58','It was sheer pleasure to witness his precision power on the field. His ability to convert penalty corners into goals with perfection made Jugraj Singh the blue-eyed boy of Indian Hockey. Indians celebrated his arrival as they found a flicker in him after a long wait and was touted then as the next big thing. However, as fate had it, the celebrations were cut short when he met with a terrible car accident at Dakoha near Jalandhar. Since then, he has never been able to make a successful comeback.\r\n\r\nHowever, he continues to serve the country\'s hockey team, in a different role though. The 28-year-old is currently designated as the penalty corner coach to oversee the current bunch of flickers. \r\n\r\nA self-taught penalty-corner specialist, Jugraj opened up his views on Indian drag-flickers, hockey and much more to Zeenews.com\'s Nishad Vellur.\r\n\r\nExcerpts:\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about the current performance of the Indian team in the ongoing hockey Olympic qualifiers? Do you think India can gain back the past glory and popularity?\r\n\r\nAs one can see the Indian team is doing a wonderful job at the moment. The boys are doing a good job and most importantly, there is unity in the team. They are performing as a team, which I am sure will bring us good results. It is a good sign for Indian hockey and if we continue to go down this road, we can definitely bring back the past glory.\r\n\r\nHow do the Indian drag-flickers compare with others in the Olympics? \r\n\r\nWe have world class drag-flickers in the team. I can proudly say that they are the best in the world, which any team would like to have. Sandeep Singh is the main flicker for us and fortunately he is seizing all the opportunities he gets to score goals. Raghunath and Ravinder Pal Singh are equally important to India but they are not getting a lot of chances right now as Sandeep is on a roll.\r\n\r\nRegarding rating, as of now, I would give them 9 out of 10.','content-images/jugraj.jpg','I will give 10 out of 10 to Nobbs: Jugraj Singh','It was sheer pleasure to witness his precision power on the field.',10,1),(3,'DNA Correspondent | Place: Mumbai | Agency: DNA','2012-02-24 08:03:04','\"India are playing well in the Olympic qualifiers,\" said former captain Rajpal Singh. \"They have been fast and aggressive. However, they should concede fewer goals.\" Singh, along with Viren Rasquinha and Adrian D\'Souza, was at a suburban hotel for the unveiling of the World Series Hockey trophy.\r\n\r\nRasquinha, too, was positive about India\'s chances. \"We\'ve been playing good hockey. The players have looked intense. The fitness levels seem to be good. We need to carry this momentum to the final,\" he said.\r\n\r\nA few questions were raised over Yuvraj Walmiki\'s fitness.\r\n\r\nWalmiki had suffered a hamstring injury before the game against Canada. \"Yuvraj is a fine player,\" said Adrian. \"He needs to recover and be 100 per cent if India go to London.\"\r\n\r\nIndia play Poland on Friday and the players expressed their confidence in the team. \"It\'s a talented side. They are taking their chances when given penalty corners, so there is no reason why they shouldn\'t do well,\" concluded Singh.\r\n\r\nPresent at the function was Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan.

Nabi fed Abraches to pull one back for India in the 64th minte. \r\n\r\nIndia conceded two quick goals in the dying moments of the match with Hasan Rabie and Abdullah Thuwaini punishing a demoralised Indians with a strike each in the 87th and 90th minutes. \r\n\r\nThe match was part of preparation for India\'s participation in the AFC Challenge Cup from March 8-19 in Nepal. \r\n\r\nIndia Squad: Karanjit Singh; Samir Naik, Anwar Ali, Gourmangi Singh, Gurjinder Singh, Anthony Pereira (Syed Rahim Nabi 60th), Baldeep Singh Jr (Lenny Rodrigues 50th minute), Lester Fernandes (Francis Fernandes 56th), Jewel Raja; Sushil Singh (Manandeep Singh 80th), Joaquim Abranches.','content-images/samir.png','Oman thrash India 5-1 in an international friendly','The absence of the some established players showed as India were clueless.',7,3),(5,'PTI | Feb 26, 2012, 06.50PM IST','2012-02-26 20:23:18','MUMBAI: A number of players, now touring Australia, are likely to be axed when the national cricket selectors meet on February 29 to choose the team for the Asia Cup cricket tournament that will also feature Pakistan Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. \r\n\r\nThe meeting of the selection committee, to be chaired by Krishnamachari Srikkanth, comes after another crushing defeat for India in the tri-series match against Australia in Sydney in which players like Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja stood out as failures. \r\n\r\nJadeja, who was bought by skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni\'s Chennai Super Kings for a whopping USD 2 million, failed again by making only 8 runs to give team a total of 101 runs in seven matches of the tri-series for an average of 16.83. \r\n\r\nHe has been touted as an all-rounder but has taken only two wickets for an average of 142. \r\n\r\nThe limitation of Raina, who has an excellent record at home, was exposed again in Sunday\'s match when he scored just 8 runs to give him an aggregate of 142 runs in seven matches for an average of 20.28. \r\n\r\nHis excellent fielding may not be enough for him to retain his place. \r\n\r\nA key question before the selectors would concern Sachin Tendulkar -- whether he would make himself available for selection and whether he will be picked up after a poor run in ODIs in Australia. \r\n\r\nVirender Sehwag\'s bad form is another issue to be addressed by the selectors. It would not come as a surprise if he is ignored. \r\n\r\nAsia Cup may give the selectors an opportunity to try out the likes of Manoj Tiwary, who is part of the ODI team in Australia, but has not been given an opportunity. \r\n\r\nOpener Ajinkya Rahane, Rajasthan\'s Robin Bist, who emerged as the highest run-scorer in Ranji trophy this season, are some of the players who can get a chance. \r\n\r\nStumper batsman Dinesh Karthik, who hit three centuries this season so far, is also an option for the selectors as he can be used as an opener as well. \r\n\r\nThe selection committee meeting to pick the team was advanced by a day to February 29 from March 1. \r\n\r\nIndia are to clash with Sri Lanka in their opening match of the tournament on March 13.','','Axe hanging on non-performing Indian players','A number of players, now touring Australia, are likely to be axed.',5,3),(6,'Navneet Singh, Hindustan Times','2012-02-26 20:25:38','The international hockey federation\'s (FIH) legal battle with the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) could leave the former with egg on the face. HT has learnt that the FIH disciplinary committee has told FIH president, Leandro Negre, to settle the dispute amicably, as the dice is heavily loaded in IHF\'s favor.\r\n\r\nThe FIH had de-recognised the IHF and made Hockey India (HI) the sole body to run the sport in the country. A peeved IHF had then approached the disciplinary panel.\r\n\r\nCrisis on the anvil\r\n\r\nA source said that the first round had gone in IHF\'s favour, adding that, “The world body is staring at a big crisis. The disciplinary committee cannot hold back the decision for very long.”\r\n\r\nThe source also said that if the case goes to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), headquartered in Lausanne, “the FIH might have to pay a huge compensation to the IHF, which might empty its coffers”.\r\n\r\n“The amount could be three-four folds of what the FIH has earned from hosting international tournaments in the country so far,” he said.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, this is the reason why the FIH top officials, including Negre, are holding regular meetings with the IHF.\r\n\r\nFIH\'s main agenda during the meetings has been to end the legal wrangle. But nothing concrete has emerged so far.\r\n\r\nSince the IHF is in a strong position, it is unlikely to compromise. The mood can be gauged from the fact that the discussion on the (IHF-HI) merger has been put on the backburner.\r\n\r\nIHF president, RK Shetty, refused to share the details of the meetings. “My lawyers have told me not to speak,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe IHF has also reportedly told Negre that they would not merge with HI. It is the latter which will have to climb down. The IHF has also suggested a nine-point plan for the merger, which gives the body the upper hand.\r\n\r\nChange of heart\r\n\r\nLast year in July, when sports minister, Ajay Maken, had drawn up a 10-point plan for the merger of HI and IHF, the FIH had rubbished the move. So, why this overture now?\r\n\r\nOver the years, the FIH has earned millions by giving hosting rights for major international tournaments to the Indian Olympic Association\'s (IOA) ad-hoc committee and HI. But they were oblivious to the trouble round the corner, as the IHF is the body recognised by the government.\r\n\r\nWhen the threat of the IHF approaching CAS became a reality, the FIH finally woke up.','','World body faces heat on IHF issue','The international hockey federation\'s (FIH) legal battle with the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) could leave the former with egg on the face.',10,0),(7,'Tashi Lundup : Chandigarh, Sun Feb 26 2012, 01:59 hrs','2012-02-26 23:17:42','Much before the tournament, Sanam Singh, back in Chandigarh from a rigorous and physically tiring ITF tournament in Turkey, had said how much rankings would matter in the coming few months, be it to secure a place in the Indian Davis Cup team or, more importantly, the London Olympics. On Saturday, in Chandigarh at the CLTA Stadium courts where he had learned the basics of the game, he defeated N Sriram Balaji 7-5, 6-3 in the final to win the $10, 000 ITF men’s Futures title.\r\n\r\nThis was his first singles ITF title since turning professional last year and the fourth ITF title overall that includes two in the doubles category. His first singles ITF title — India F8 Futures — had come in 2005.\r\n\r\n“There could not be a better place to win my first ITF singles title other than Chandigarh. It is good to win the title at home after turning pro and in front of the people who have supported me a lot,” said Sanam (24), whose ranking will certainly shoot up when the new list comes out. He is currently ranked 776.\r\n\r\nSanam may, in fact, better his career best ranking of 733. Unseeded in the tournament, Sanam, who was playing in a tournament in Chandigarh for the first time after moving base to University of Virginia in 2007, suddenly became the favourite to win it after he had shown the exit door to top seed Vishu Vardhan in the pre-quarterfinals.\r\n\r\nHowever, pitted against him in the final was another unseeded player L Sriram Balaji, who like Sanam was playing impressive tennis and had beaten seeded players to march into the final. It was Balaji who called the shots and Sanam found himself staring at the barrel, two games down in the first game.\r\n\r\nBalaji, shot some powerful aces past him and Sanam took time to settle down. At 5-2, the big serving Balaji fancied his chances but Sanam made a stunning comeback and won the next three games in succession to level at 5-all. What then began were long rallies and ground strokes from the baseline as both the players matched stroke for stroke. However, Sanam won crucial points and annexed the first set. He was more dominating in the second set and easily overpowered Balaji 6-3.\r\n\r\n“The last six-seven months have been very difficult for me. After graduating from the University of Virginia, it was difficult to adjust myself to the professional circuit because playing at the college and professional levels are two different things. However, I am happy to have won the title,” said Sanam, who had won the doubles title with Alexandre Lacroxix of France at the ITF Men’s Futures Tennis Tournament in Claremont, California, in September last year.\r\n\r\nNow, with an ITF title under his wings and still more tournaments to play in the coming times, Sanam is one of India’s hopes at the 2012 London Olympics. AITA has sanctioned $36, 000 for Sanam for hiring a personal coach and travel grants to get in shape for the quadrennial event.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1997 that Sanam first stepped on the CLTA courts under the Junior Development Programme. In the next six years till 2003, he went on to become one of the top players from the region. He did his schooling from St John’s School (Sector 26), Chandigarh, before moving to NTA.','content-images/sanam.jpg','Sanam wins first singles ITF title since turning pro, that too at home','London Olympics hopeful beats N Sriram Balaji 7-5, 6-3 at CLTA Stadium courts, where he learned his tennis ropes under Junior Development Programme',8,4),(8,'Biswajyoti Brahma, TNN | Feb 27, 2012, 12.49AM IST','2012-02-26 23:21:59','NEW DELHI: It\'s time to pack your bags for London. With an emphatic, clinical display, India made up for the slight of missing the Olympic Games last time around by booking their berth for London with an 8-1 trouncing of France. \r\n\r\nResults | Points Table \r\n\r\nMaybe, this will mark the beginning of a turnaround for India\'s national game. It took 17 minutes for India to score their first goal, and after that it was mostly one-way traffic as the hosts answered the prayers of thousands inside the stadium, and millions all over the country, with style and panache here on Sunday. \r\n\r\nEgged on by thousands of supporters at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium, India slammed three goals in the first half and five more in the second to make it to the Olympics four years after the humiliation of missing out on a berth in Beijing. \r\n\r\nIndia were led in their charge by Sandeep Singh, with the drag-flicker scoring five goals, including a hat-trick, to fashion the win. Such was Sandeep\'s dominance that he scored five goals from the six penalty corners India received. The other scorers for India were Birendra Lakra, SV Sunil and VR Raghunath. \r\n\r\nThe stage could not have been set better for India, who came to the tournament as favourites and dominated it completely. They were exceptional in almost all their matches, and Sunday was no exception. \r\n\r\nWith a nearly-packed stadium cheering every move made by the hosts, it was never going to be easy for France, who started solidly by crowding their defence to deny any soft goals. But the attacking Indians slowed down their game a bit to allow their rivals open up. \r\n\r\nThe plan worked as Virendra Lakra lapped up the opportunity when he received a pass inside the circle from Manpreet Singh to slam home India\'s first goal. India took full advantage of the third umpire, which was put into use for the classification matches for the first time in the tournament. \r\n\r\nShivendra Singh appealed successfully for a foul inside the rival defence and the result was a penalty corner for India, which was successfully converted by Sandeep for his first goal. \r\n\r\nFrance did manage to give the home fans some anxious moment when they slammed home through Simon Martin-Brisac. Then it was Sandeep\'s show all through as India went to the break with a 3-1 lead. The hosts came back to the second half in a more belligerent mood. With France opening up desperately seeking to score goals, it gave them a chance to make regular inroads into the rival defence. \r\n\r\nSix more goals in the second half - four of them coming through Sandeep and one each through SV Sunil and VR Raghunath - ensured that India booked a ticket to London in style. \r\n\r\nFrance had their moments in the match, but an alert PR Sreejesh under the bar ensured that they failed to score more than once. Sreejesh\'s performance was sublime and he played a stellar role in denying France a goal from the seven penalty corners they received. \r\n\r\nIn the end, a victory lap by the Indians to thanks the crowd for their support was cheered with huge roar. The Olympic berth was likely to give a boost to the national team, which was struggling to hog the limelight in the wake of some ordinary on-field performances and controversies off it. \r\n\r\nThe win resulted in immediate cash rewards for the team, with Hockey India as well as a city hotel announcing a Rs 1 lakh bounty for each players and Rs 50,000 for support staff. \r\n\r\nIn earlier matches, Canada overcame a fighting Poland 4-3 to win the bronze, while Italy outclassed Singapore 5-0 to finish fifth in the tournament. \r\n\r\nCanada took the lead in the fourth minute before Poland equalized five minutes later.

Brent Livermore and Vikram Pillay in the midfield held on gamely striving hard to find openings.\r\n\r\nIt was the Pune Strykers who showed more consistency and craft in the workouts. Served beautifully by the Canadian stalwart, Ken Pereira, and supported well by Birendra Lakra, the midfield controlled the trend almost impeccably.\r\n\r\nEQUALISER\r\n\r\nThe equaliser from an eye-catching backhander by Rohan Minz conveyed the mood of the Pune team. When Imran Warsi pumped in a penalty corner in the second quarter, the retaliation was swift and sure. A long pass by Pereira provided a perfect platform for the Argentine star, Mario Alamada, to flick across a measured centre. Bikash Toppo provided the finishing touches.\r\n\r\nA goal line save by Amit Gowda delayed the third goal for Chennai.\r\n\r\nBut Imran netted his 10th goal in the championship, raising hopes of a victory. Cheetahs went into the fourth quarter with a 3-2 lead.\r\n\r\nBut six minutes before the hooter came the leveller from the gangling Simrandeep Randhawa, pushing the Chennai supporters into the valley of disappointment.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, the verdict fully justified the run of play. For the Chennai team, it was again a case of so near and yet so far.\r\n\r\nCheetahs take on Karnataka Lions on Saturday.\r\n\r\nThe result:\r\n\r\nChennai Cheetahs 3 (Adam Sinclair, Imran Warsi 2) drew with Pune Strykers 3 (Roshan Minz, Bikas Toppo, Simrandeep Randhawa).\r\n\r\nTomorrow\'s matches: Chennai Cheetahs vs Karnataka Lions (7 p.m.), Chennai; Bhopal Badshahs vs Sher-e-Punjab (9 p.m.), Bhopal.\r\n\r\nCorrection: The owners of the Chennai Cheetahs are the Nanwanis and not the Lalwanis as stated in the report that appeared on March 9.','content-images/cheetah.jpg','Cheetahs, Strykers play out a draw','In a contest that was eventful and exciting, Chennai Cheetahs managed only a 3-3 draw against Pune Strykers, in the Bridgestone World Series Hockey (WSH), at the Mayor Radhakrishnan Stadium on Friday.',10,2),(21,'PTI','2012-03-11 03:45:01','Host Bhopal Badshahs notched up a convincing 2-1 victory over Delhi Wizards in its first home match of the inaugural World Series Hockey tournament here on Friday.\r\n\r\nBhopal, which had two wins, a draw and a loss so far, scored through Karan Bhaskaran (14th minute), A.B.

The forward pumped in three goals apart being involved in an assist for another.\r\n\r\nLions went ahead in the second quarter through Ravipal. A mis-pass by Sunil Yadav saw the ball going to straight to Vinayak Bijwad, who relayed it to Ravipal and the striker made no mistake.\r\n\r\nRavipal then worked in from the right, dribbling past at least two defenders, and all Bijwad had to do was to push it home to make it 2-0 at half-time.\r\n\r\nDrag-flick specialist Imran Warsi was at his best in penalty corner conversion and he reduced the margin with a neat drive at the beginning of the third quarter. Progressively, the host\'s defence crumbled and the Lions\' frontline capitalised on it.\r\n\r\nLions didn\'t look like a side that was wallowing at the bottom. The fourth quarter was a classic exhibition of attacking hockey. Ravipal scored two field goals in a matter of six minutes by making a mockery of Cheetahs\' defence.\r\n\r\nWarsi\'s second penalty corner goal was a case of too little, too late. Towards the closing stages, Deepak Kullu compounded Cheetahs\' woes with a strong push home. Mark Harris\' deflection off a penalty corner minutes before hooter, meant little to Cheetahs\' prospects.\r\n\r\nBrace by Deepak\r\n\r\nDeepak Thakur struck twice as Sher-E-Punjab staved off a good challenge from Bhopal Badhshahs to score a 3-2 win in Bhopal.\r\n\r\nThe results:\r\n\r\nAt Chennai: Karnataka Lions 5 (Ravipal Singh 3, Vinayak Bijwad, Deepak Kullu) bt Chennai Cheetahs 3 (Imran Warsi 2, Mark Harris).\r\n\r\nAt Bhopal: Sher-E-Punjab 3 (Deepak Thakur 17 & 46, Harpreet 53) bt Bhopal Badshahs 2 (Sameer Dad 22, Lalit Kumar Upadhyay 58).\r\n\r\nSunday\'s matches: Pune Strykers v Chandigarh Comets, Pune, 7 p.m.; Mumbai Marines v Delhi Wizards, Mumbai, 9 p.m.','content-images/ravipal.jpg','Ravipal stars in Lions\' win','Perched precariously at the bottom of the table, Karnataka Lions scripted an authoritative 5-3 win over Chennai Cheetahs in the World Series Hockey',10,2);
